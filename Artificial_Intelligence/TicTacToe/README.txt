	In the project is implemented the minimax and alfa-beta algorithms for a 2-player game of TicTacToe.

	To use a player with minimax algorithm use the "minimax" parameter as an argument for the main.
	To use a player with alpfa-beta algorithm use the "alfa-beta" parameter as an argument for the main.

	Both of them calculates the best movement (for the respective player) given a state.

	The class position works as an action.
