The separator of command sequence is "&". There are problems with "^".
Use "history" to show the history (maximum 20) of commands used.
Use "!1" to use the first command in history. 
Use "!#" to use the last command in history.

There are only supported:
	-> ls
	-> cd (PROBLEMS)
	-> echo
	-> ping
	-> ipconfig/ifconfig
	-> history
	-> exit
